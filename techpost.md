# Elasticsearch, Solr and Lucene
## How they can help us?
Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene are open-source search engines and document-oriented databases. Elasticsearch and Solr which are built on Apache lucence they are designed for scalability and performance and they excel at full-text and also a near real-time search platform having the ability to index many types of content mean that they can be used for a number of use cases
### Here let us see few important use cases:
* Application search
* Website search
* Enterprise search
* Application performance monitoring

## How do they work?
Daily thousands, or millions, of documents that need to be searched. Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications. Here the data ingestion comes into the scene by which raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before it is indexed in Elasticsearch or Solr. Once indexed in Elasticsearch or Solr, users can run complex queries against their data and use aggregations to retrieve complex summaries of their data. users can create powerful visualizations of their data, share dashboards, and this altogether makes searching data easier and brings scalability, speed, and best performance.
### They support a variety of programming languages.

### Here let us see some of the most popular programming languages are supported by them.
1. Java

1. JavaScript (Node.js)
